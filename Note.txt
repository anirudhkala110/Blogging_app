import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  server:{
    allow:['node_modules', './bootstrap-icons/font/bootstap-icons.css']
  }
})

bootstap icons wasn't working hence this is the method should use to make it work
we are using vite + react and to run this command is npm  run dev

create a table first using the server js.. and then after use the
 UserModel to make it work properly and to grant the permission we
  need to run MySQL and has to run SQL query to provide 
  previlleges to all users and then flush privilleges
